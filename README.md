# LoanApproval-App
Loan Approval Application with GAE - Jersey, Heroku, Maven, Silex (And extensions)

###DEMO 
Google App Engine : http://loanapprovalkhettabgil.appspot.com/api/

Heroku 1 (LoanApproval) : http://morning-headland-94280.herokuapp.com/

Heroku 2 (Interface) : http://whispering-coast-32850.herokuapp.com/

During my classes , I had to make a LoanApproval type application in tandem with Khettab Myriam . So we create two separate APIs, the first was on GoogleAppEngine and persisted on Google Datastore . The second she was on Heroku and was generated from Maven using important libraries like Jersey JAX -RS , for example.

 Finally, we opted for a typical application WEB client to use the Heroku API which used GoogleAppEngine .
